It was rainy day when I've finished my new blog built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). What's the theme of the blog? I think, this blog will be 90% about development stuff and other 10% – my personal, like games, music and cars.

{% respimg
    src="/img/sample.jpeg",
    width="520",
    sizes="500, 1000",
    alt="Simple Pic",
    loading="lazy"
%}

The main reason I've started this blog – I wanted my personal space in the WWW (World Wide Web, of course). I've attempted to create blogs before, but it all ended in development of React/Vue theme.

### Who am I?

I am self-taught frontend developer with 15+ year experience. I've made my first page in Word and then another first site in Notepad. There was no IDE at that time or syntax highlighters or even autocomplete features, only 'HTML for Dummies' books and the source code. 

Surprisingly, I don't have (yet?) any big projects maintained.
